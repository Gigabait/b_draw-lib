# Bull's neat little drawing library
Ever wanted to draw textures/materials from the internet rather than vtfs/hardmounted pngs?
Me too. 

# Current functions: 
Draw a webimage from a url in an identical fashion to draw.RoundedBox

`draw.WebImage( url, x, y, width, height, color=Color(255,255,255) )`

Draw a steam user's avatar; sizes are "large", "medium", "small"

`draw.SteamAvatar( string steamID64, string size = "small", x, y, width, height, color=Color(255,255,255) )`
